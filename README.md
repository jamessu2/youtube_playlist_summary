# youtube_playlist_summary
Print out the videos in a Youtube playlist, and count the total watch time for the entire playlist

# Goals
- (DONE) Create a Youtube API key 
- Fetch the JSON data for the playlist, and load it to a dictionary
- Loop through the data to retrieve all video titles
- Loop through the data to retrieve all video time lengths
- Calculate the sum of all video time lengths
- Print out a summary of video titles, their lenghts, 
	and the name of the playlist, as well as the total time of the playlist

Note: There is a difference between "Total items in playlist" vs "Public items in playlist"


# Install/Setup
```
git clone "https://github.com/jamessu2/youtube_playlist_summary.git"
cd youtube_playlist_summary
```

You will need to go to the Youtube API page, log in with your account, and quickly click a few buttons to get a API key â€“ which you will put into the script.

Assuming you've never created an API key before, don't worry: it's super simple.

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/ (sign in if needed)
2. Create a "NEW PROJECT" 
	- (which will be under a "Select a project" option in the topbar if you've never created a project before)
	- Name the project whatever you want (I called mine "python_youtube")
	- It will take a few seconds to create.
3. Again, make sure you're at the API home page: https://console.developers.google.com/. You should be in the Dashboard section, where there's an option near the top to "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES". Click on that option.
4. Search for "Youtube Data API v3"
5. Click "ENABLE" to enable the API
	- Now you have created your own API
6. Back at the home page, click on the "Credentials" section, click on "CREATE CREDENTIALS" in the topbar, and select the "API key" option
7. Copy the API key that was generated, and paste it into the youtube_playlist_summary.py file near the top, as indicated by comments in the file

Note: Code was tested with Youtube API as of Dec 2019.
